Hi, Iâ€™m Sahaj. I turn deeply technical insights into products that people love.

My academic interest began in computational neuroscience, when I analyzed macaque MRIs to investigate the effects of SSRI antidepressants on neonatal brain development. During my undergrad at Stanford, I researched the counterpart to human intelligence, publishing with the Stanford AI Lab in generative modeling and Google in natural language processing.

Most recently, I led the AI team at Luminous Computing, where we were building the world's largest supercomputer on a chip using photonics. Our team was responsible for determining the first system architecture for a Luminous product, which spanned need finding with ML engineers, understanding system capabilities from our photonics and digital teams, and iteration on technical system designs.

I fill my free time with a (healthy) dose of existential angst, hiking, squash, and philosophical fiction.

You can better understand how I see the world by reading my [principles](https://sahajgarg.github.io/blog/principles) and how I approach my work by reading my [thoughts on designing effectively](https://sahajgarg.github.io/blog/design)!
