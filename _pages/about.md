Hi, Iâ€™m Sahaj. I turn deeply technical insights into products that people love.

Currently, I'm a co-founder/CTO at Wispr, where our mission is to advance technology to a point where we can close the gap between our intentions and the actions we can accomplish in the world. We are building a wearable neural interface that will advance communication -- see more at [wispr.ai](https://wispr.ai). 

My academic interest began in computational neuroscience, when I analyzed macaque MRIs to investigate the effects of SSRI antidepressants on neonatal brain development. During my undergrad at Stanford, I researched the counterpart to human intelligence, publishing with the Stanford AI Lab in diffusion based generative modeling and Google in natural language processing.

Most recently, I led the AI team at Luminous Computing, where we were building the world's largest supercomputer on a chip using photonics. Our team was responsible for determining the first system architecture for a Luminous product, which spanned need finding with ML engineers, understanding system capabilities from our photonics and digital teams, and iteration on technical system designs.

I spend my free time creating rich memories with my wife and close friends, reflecting, scuba diving, and reading. I am married to my high school sweetheart,
 [Shruti Ramanathan](https://www.instagram.com/shrutir16). She is a force of nature, and has an uncanny ability to understand people and move groups towards
 ambitious goals. I look forward to creating a lifetime of memories with her.
