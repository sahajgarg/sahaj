Hi! Iâ€™m Sahaj, the AI lead at Luminous Computing, a startup working to accelerate AI by using light to move data around computer chips faster. Before that, I graduated from Stanford at the top of my engineering class (Henry Ford II Scholar). There, I was a published researcher in the Stanford AI lab working on generative modeling, and interned with Google, where I developed tools and methods for making natural language models less biased. In my free time, I enjoy a (healthy) dose of existential angst, hiking, squash, and reading.

You can better understand how I see the world by reading my [principles](https://sahajgarg.github.io/blog/principles) and how I approach my work by reading my [thoughts on designing effectively](https://sahajgarg.github.io/blog/design)!
