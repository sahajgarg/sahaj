I’ve been trying to improve my posture and flexibility for years, but it’s never worked. That’s because the problem was never where I thought it was: there were bottlenecks elsewhere in my body that were preventing me from fixing my problems.

My lower back hurts far too often for someone in their twenties, like many of the other engineers I know, and much of the issue stems from frozen hamstrings and weak hip flexors. For example, the furthest I could bend down was one foot from my toes! Many physical therapists emphasized hamstring stretches, but no matter how often I did them, nothing improved. That’s because I missed the bottlenecks: glutes, sciatic nerve, and calves. Because these areas were so tight, my hamstrings weren’t being stretched whatsoever with targeted stretches. By working through these muscle groups simultaneously with my hamstrings, I could touch my toes within a month.

Comprehensive stretching has been critical to improving my overall flexibility, since the limitations are never where I expect them to be. Following a comprehensive routine fixes this problem: at any given time, half of the routine may not hit the tightest parts of the body, but it will always cover the unexpected tight areas. These areas change rapidly over time; suddenly, I’ve realized how certain stretches are supposed to feel, and which muscles they engage, whereas before, I was too bottlenecked elsewhere to feel anything from that stretch. For example, I never felt my hip flexors in a lunge until I worked through my glutes. It’s a remarkable feeling to feel a stretch where you never knew there was one. As bottlenecks are resolved and new ones arise elsewhere every week, comprehensive routines always target the limiting muscle group.

The most dramatic improvements from applying this stretching philosophy have been to my rounded shoulders and nerd neck. The canonical advice of chin tucks and chest stretches never worked for me, since they always missed one bottleneck or the other. Instead, it was necessary to target the broader "upper cross syndrome," which involves tightness in places like the levator scapula, pec minor, and scalene in the neck and chest, the pec minor, and weak muscles like the mid/lower traps, rhomboid, and deep cervical flexors in the back and neck. I would always miss one of these somewhere or the other, and all postural improvement would stall, but addressing all of them jointly has shown more improvements in weeks than previous years of effort.

Some of the routines that have helped me the most: an [overall flexibility routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPKRiU9u_Hc&ab_channel=TomMerrick), guided [hamstring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ymjw7TSzrE&ab_channel=TomMerrick) and [rounded shoulders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkxdnU0Ppiw&ab_channel=TomMerrick) routines, and explanations of bottlenecks for [upper cross syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXLRVXFBxzM&ab_channel=TomMerrick) and [anterior pelvic tilts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp8KPPffIJw&ab_channel=TomMerrick). After writing this, I realized that a single comprehensive routine would probably miss some limiting factors, so I swapped in others, and found bottlenecks in my internal hip rotation, groin, and shoulder extensions. Comprehensive really means comprehensive! Just twenty minutes a day (consistency is king!) with one of these routines has led to the biggest improvements in my physical health in years!
